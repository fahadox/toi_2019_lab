To install jupyter natively onto the MAC workstations:
```
easy_install --user pip
export PATH=$HOME/Library/Python/2.7/bin:$PATH
pip install --user jupyter
```
and this will install it for them to use.  Note that this is Python 2.7
because that's the version that comes with Mac OS and we don't have
Python 3 installed.  

To start lab1:

1) To start jupyter notebook, in terminal:

```
jupyter notebook
```

This will open a window in your web browser.

2) Navigate to your project

3) Open Lab1_notebook.ipynb to start
